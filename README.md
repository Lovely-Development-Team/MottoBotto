# MottoBotto
MottoBotto is a configurable Discord bot with a penchant for mottos and words to live by. It sends nominated mottos to an AirTable base for further use.

## Interacting with MottoBotto

To nominate a motto for consideration, reply to the Discord message with one of MottoBotto's trigger phrases. The default triggers can be found in the [section below](#mottobottos-defaults). MottoBotto will respond to your message with an emoji reaction indicating whether the nomination was accepted, rejected, invalid, or previously nominated.

### Rules MottoBotto follows when accepting mottos

Mottos that are considered valid by MottoBotto are:

* at least two words in length,
* between five and 240 characters in length,
* are not purely punctuation, emoji, or numeric, and
* do not tag any Discord users.

Any suggested motto that doesn't conform to these rules will be responded to with aüôÖemoji reaction.

MottoBotto will also reject any nomination that is a statement made by either yourself or MottoBotto.

### Rules humans should follow when suggesting mottos

They are all prepended with `^` before matching, to ensure they match the start of the message. The message is first stripped of leading and trailing whitespace before matching. |

\*Note: Regular expressions used for motto nomination rule matching are matched with case sensitivity, and must include the `^` and `$` if you wish to match against the entire message string. Those used for trigger phrases are matched without regard for case.
