## Interacting with MottoBotto

### Rules MottoBotto follows.

### Rules humans should follow.
1. The rules of the server should always be followed, and trump any other rules written here.
2. Aim to nominate mottos that have a useful sentiment rather than solely japes. The aim is to have a useful database of mottos from a variety of users that people can look over and get use from.
3. Do not abuse MottoBotto. Channels should not become spammed with nominations at the expense of the actual conversation that is happening. MottoBotto should aid the discussion, not hinder it.
4. Don’t fish for mottos. While there is a leaderboard, don’t try and cheat the system just to raise up the ranks. Instead, contribute to discussion naturally and helpfully and your reign will come.
