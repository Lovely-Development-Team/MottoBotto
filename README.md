To nominate a motto for consideration, reply to the Discord message with one of MottoBotto's trigger phrases. The default triggers can be found in the [section below](#mottobottos-defaults). MottoBotto will respond to your message with an emoji reaction indicating whether the nomination was accepted, rejected, invalid, or previously nominated.

### Rules MottoBotto follows when accepting mottos

Mottos that are considered valid by MottoBotto are:

* at least two words in length,
* between five and 240 characters in length,
* are not purely punctuation, emoji, or numeric, and
