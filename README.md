# MottoBotto
MottoBotto is a configurable Discord bot with a penchant for mottos and words to live by. It sends nominated mottos to an AirTable base for further use.

## Interacting with MottoBotto

To nominate a motto for consideration, reply to the Discord message with one of MottoBotto's trigger phrases. The default triggers can be found in the [section below](#mottobottos-defaults). MottoBotto will respond to your message with an emoji reaction indicating whether the nomination was accepted, rejected, invalid, or previously nominated.

### Rules MottoBotto follows when accepting mottos

Mottos that are considered valid by MottoBotto are:

* at least two words in length,
* between five and 240 characters in length,
* are not purely punctuation, emoji, or numeric, and
* do not tag any Discord users.

Any suggested motto that doesn't conform to these rules will be responded to with a🙅emoji reaction.

MottoBotto will also reject any nomination that is a statement made by either yourself or MottoBotto.

### Rules humans should follow when suggesting mottos
1. The rules of the server should always be followed, and trump any other rules written here.
2. Aim to nominate mottos that have a useful sentiment rather than solely japes. The aim is to have a useful database of mottos from a variety of users that people can look over and get use from.
3. Do not abuse MottoBotto. Channels should not become spammed with nominations at the expense of the actual conversation that is happening. MottoBotto should aid the discussion, not hinder it.
4. Don’t fish for mottos. While there is a leaderboard, don’t try and cheat the system just to raise up the ranks. Instead, contribute to discussion naturally and helpfully and your reign will come.
